Scaling
#########

-> Scalability is one of the major advantage in the Cloud

-> Scalability means we can increase / decrease our Resources based on demand

-> Scaling can be done in 2 ways

1) Verticle Scaling

2) Horizontal Scaling


-> Increasing capacity of existing system is called as Verticle Scaling

			8 GB RAM ----> 32 GB RAM -----> 64 GB ------> 128 GB ------> 512 GB

			1 vCPU	  -----> 4 vCPU

			256 SSD    ----> 512 SSD

Note: Upto certain limit only we can do verticle scaling


-> Increasing no.of systems/servers is called as Horizontal Scaling

			3 servers ----> 6 servers ---> 10 servers



Note:  Adding & Removing servers manually is difficult and time taking process.

-> We can't guess how much traffic we will get for our application.


############
Auto Scaling
#############

-> It is a process of increasing / decreasing no.of servers based on traffic


If More Request are coming ---> servers will be added

If less requests are coming ---> servers will be removed


Note: Auto Scaling will predict the traffic coming to our application


******* AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. ******

Benefits of Auto Scaling
########################

1) Fault tolerance : Detect when an instance is unhealthy, terminate it, and launch an instance to replace it.

2) Availability : Ensure that your application always has the right amount of capacity to handle the current traffic demand.

3) Cost Management : Save money by dynamically launching instances when they are needed and terminating them when they aren't.

Working with AutoScaling
############################

1) Create Launch Template

2) Create AutoScaling Group with Launch Template

3) Check EC2 instances Running

4) Terminate the ec2 instance created by AutoScaling

5) After sometime veriy EC2 instances running, terminated instance will be replaced with new instance
