=====================
Application Environments
=====================

-> Environment means the platform which is used to run our application

-> In Realtime, we will use multiple environments to run our application

				-> DEV Environment
		
				-> SIT Environment

				-> UAT Environment

				-> Pilot Environment

				-> Prod Environment

-> Developers will use DEV environment for integration testing. 

-> SIT env will be used by Software Testing team to test our application functionality. SIT stands for System Integration Testing.

-> UAT means User Acceptance Testing. UAT will done by Client. For client testing we will give UAT environment.

Note: After UAT testing, client will decide GO or No-GO. GO means go for production deployment. No-GO means production deployment cancelled.

-> When client identify some critical bugs in UAT then they will say No GO.

-> PILOT env is called as pre-prod environment. It is used for live data testing.

-> Prod env is called live environment. The application which is deployed in PROD env will be available for public users access.


Note: To deploy the project into these environments we will use Jenkins software.




1) Maven : Build Tool

2) Git Hub : Source Code Repository s/w

3) Nexus : Artifactory Repository to upload artifacts & to create shared libraries

4) SonarQube : Code Quality Checking / Code Review S/w

5) Tomcat : Web Server to run our web applications

6) Jenkins: CI CD software which is used to automate build & deployments

Note: Created one pipeline using all above tools to perform build & deployment
