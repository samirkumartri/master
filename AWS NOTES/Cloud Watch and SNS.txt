Amazon Cloud Watch
++++++++++++++++++

Amazon CloudWatch is a component of Amazon Web Services that provides monitoring for AWS resources and the customer applications running on the Amazon infrastructure.

CloudWatch enables real-time monitoring of AWS resources such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances. The application automatically collects and provides metrics for CPU utilization, latency and request counts. Users can also stipulate additional metrics to be monitored, such as memory usage, transaction volumes or error rate.
